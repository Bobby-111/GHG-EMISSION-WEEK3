# 🌍 GHG Emissions Prediction using Machine Learning

This project presents an AI-powered solution for predicting Greenhouse Gas (GHG) emissions using machine learning models. It leverages historical environmental data and regression techniques to forecast future emissions, supporting climate action (SDG 13) and innovation in environmental monitoring (SDG 9).
---

## ✅ Problem Statement

Greenhouse gas emissions are a major contributor to global climate change. Traditional forecasting methods are often slow, complex, and inaccessible. This project introduces a machine learning-driven system to predict GHG emissions, enabling data-informed decisions by policymakers, researchers, and sustainability experts.

---

## 🔍 Solution

We developed a machine learning-based prediction system using **Linear Regression** and **Random Forest Regressor**. An interactive **Streamlit** web app allows users to input relevant data and receive real-time emission forecasts. This promotes digital climate action, aligning with SDG 13 (Climate Action) and SDG 9 (Innovation & Infrastructure).

## 🎯 Learning Objectives

- Understand the environmental impact of GHG emissions
- Perform data preprocessing and EDA using Python
- Train and evaluate regression models for forecasting
- Build a web app using Streamlit for real-time predictions
- Promote sustainability and digital transformation through AI
